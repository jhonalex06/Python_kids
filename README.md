# Algorithms with Turtle

*Python* is an excellent language to start programming, especially for kids. 

Usually, a *Python* course starts with algorithms definition, so I will use the library *Turtle* to show the meaning and implementation of an algorithm in *Python*.

**Definition:** An algorithm is a finite sequence of steps to generate a result.

## Work session

1. Initially, we will discuss the algorithm's concept and how a sequence of steps allows the creation of different kinds of tools.

2. Secondly, we will have the opportunity to develop ten exercises, each one with a different level of difficulty.

3. Finally, with the team, we will analyze the results of the exercises and choose the most interesting of them.
